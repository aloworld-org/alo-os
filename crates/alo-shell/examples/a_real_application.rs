//! A real application, built by somebody else, on alo OS's own compositor.
//!
//! Every other fixture in this folder draws alo OS's own surfaces, or drives a
//! test client written here to exercise one protocol. **This one starts the
//! compositor, hands its socket to a program nobody on this project wrote, and
//! photographs what arrives.**
//!
//! It exists because the owner asked a question none of the others answer:
//!
//! > Windows will be for apps not just windows so we need to design them and
//! > try installing apps and see how they look on the canvas
//!
//! What the canvas walk proves is that the machinery works — three surfaces
//! open, drag, resize, pan, zoom. What it cannot show is **what an application
//! looks like**, because its three surfaces are test rectangles a few pixels
//! across. A real client answers that and nothing else does.
//!
//! # How to run it
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run -p alo-shell --example a_real_application -- --save-to <folder>
//! cargo run -p alo-shell --example a_real_application -- --run foot --save-to <folder>
//! ```
//!
//! `--run` names the program; the default is `foot`, a small Wayland terminal.
//! Any Wayland client will do, and one that refuses tells you something too.
//!
//! # What it is not
//!
//! **Not a session.** The program is started by this fixture with the socket in
//! its environment, which is not how alo OS will launch anything — there is no
//! grant, no adapter and no record. It is a developer pointing one program at
//! one socket.
//!
//! **Not a panel.** Same as every fixture here: a nested surface under a
//! Wayland parent, software rendered under WSLg. `support/saving_frames.rs`
//! carries the rest of that, and why a saved frame is not the screenshot
//! promise.
