# Journal

One entry per loop iteration, newest last. What was built, what the gate said,
and anything the next iteration should know before it starts.

The stop markers `LOOP COMPLETE` and `LOOP HALT` are read from this file by the
supervisor, so they appear only when they are true.

---

## 2026-09-02 — before the first iteration

*(Superseded by the entry below. Kept because the warnings in it still hold.)*

The queue is written and nothing has been taken from it yet.

What exists already, outside the loop: `crates/alo-models` — the catalogue with
its licence gate, the `ModelRuntime` contract, and the Ollama adapter. 22 tests,
nine of them driving the adapter against a real socket. `cargo clippy` reports
zero warnings and zero errors against the workspace deny list.

What the next iteration should know:

- **Item 1 (grants) is the foundation**, and items 2, 3, 4 and 6 all depend on
  its vocabulary. Getting the shape wrong is expensive; read
  `docs/decisions/0001-the-capability-model.md` in full before starting, not the
  summary in the queue.
- **The gate is real and it bites.** An earlier commit in this repository
  claimed clippy was clean when it was not — ten missing-doc warnings and a
  genuine `indexing may panic` error. Run the gate, read what it says, and
  report what it said rather than what was expected.
- **`indexing_slicing` is denied workspace-wide**, tests included. In a test
  module the honest fix is an `#[expect]` with a reason, because a panic on a
  bad index there is the failure being reported. In library code, it is a bug.
- **Do not couple a test to a dependency's formatting.** One test asserted on
  the exact JSON its HTTP client emitted and failed over a space. A test that
  fails over whitespace is a test that eventually gets silenced.


---

## 2026-09-02 — queue refreshed, still before the first iteration

The loop has still not run. Everything in `crates/alo-models` was built directly
in a session, and four decisions arrived after the queue was first written, so
the queue has been rewritten against what the code actually is.

**What changed that a first iteration must know:**

- **ADR 0007 — the CPU is the default.** A GPU is acceleration. The catalogue
  states what a model costs in system memory and how it behaves without a card,
  and `default_for_cpu` picks for an ordinary laptop. Anything later that assumes
  a GPU is wrong.
- **ADR 0008 — a question is answered in one of three places**, and the person is
  always told which. `source.rs` carries that; item 4 (the record) must record
  the source, and item 5 (egress policy) starts from `SourcePolicy` rather than
  from nothing.
- **The region is the customer's to name**, and alo OS ships no default that
  chooses a provider. Built in Europe, not only for Europe. An item that
  hardcodes a region or a provider is wrong however convenient it looks.
- **`provider.rs` sets the pattern for anything holding a credential:** a
  reference into the keyring, never the secret, with a test that renders the
  struct through `Debug` and serde and asserts nothing secret-shaped survives.

**One rule of the house, before it is broken:** the loop and a person must not
work in the same checkout at once. `CLAUDE.md` forbids it, and this session came
close — the loop was reported as running in `C:/dev/alo-os` while ten commits
were being made there. It was not running; the check that said so had matched its
own command line. Whoever starts the loop owns that checkout until it reports
`LOOP COMPLETE` or halts, and nobody else edits it meanwhile.

Ten ready items. Item 1 (grants) is first because items 2, 3, 4 and 6 all speak
its vocabulary.


---

## 2026-09-02 — iteration 1: grants

**Built: item 1.** `crates/alo-capability`, a new crate holding ADR 0001 as
working code — grants now, and items 2 to 5 beside them later. The name is not
`alo-agentd` on purpose: this is the portable logic a daemon will one day serve,
and calling it the daemon would invite the Linux half to be written into it.

Four files, one job each:

| | |
|---|---|
| `reach.rs` | `Reach` — what a grant covers; `Ask` — what a verb wants to touch. Facing each other, with no method turning one into the other |
| `grant.rs` | One grant, and everything that has to be true of it, checked where it is made rather than where it is used |
| `grants.rs` | The list: what is granted to whom until when, revoke, and the refusal in words |
| `path.rs` | Whether one path is inside another, component by component, touching no disk |

**The gate:** `cargo fmt --check` clean, `cargo clippy --workspace
--all-targets -- -D warnings` zero warnings and zero errors, 72 tests passing
(28 new, 44 in `alo-models`). Built and unit tested on Windows; **no hardware
verification, and none claimed** — there is nothing here that touches a machine
yet.

Every promise the queue asked for is a test rather than a sentence: an expired
grant permits nothing (including at the exact moment it expires), a revoked one
stops on the next question, a path outside a grant is refused, and asking about
a path a hundred times leaves the list byte-identical.

**What the next iteration must know:**

- **Nothing in the crate reads the clock.** Every time-dependent question takes
  `now`. Item 3 (approvals) has the same shape of problem and should do the same
  — an approval that expires needs the same testability, and a second way of
  telling the time is a second thing to disagree about.
- **Containment is lexical.** `path.rs` decides without a syscall, which means a
  symbolic link inside a granted folder can point outside it. The rule is
  written in that file's docs: whatever executes a verb resolves the real path
  and asks about *that*. **Item 6 is where this becomes real, and getting it
  wrong there defeats item 1 entirely.**
- **Identities are matched exactly** — agent names, application ids, paths. This
  differs from `alo-models`, where provider names are compared
  case-insensitively, and the difference is deliberate: a name a person types is
  matched kindly, a name that decides reach is not. If item 2 adds verb names,
  they are identities.
- **A grant cannot be made without an end.** There is no "for ever" variant and
  zero is refused. If something later genuinely needs an indefinite grant, that
  is an ADR, not a new enum variant.
- **The errors are English in the source**, as in `alo-models`. Item 9 (strings)
  is where that gets fixed, and `GrantError` plus `Grants::refusal` are on its
  list — they are user-facing text, and `provider.rs` is not the only file
  holding some.
- **Storage is serde only.** `Grants` round-trips and handles keep counting from
  where they were, so a revoke from a stale list cannot land on a grant made
  since. *Where* the list is written belongs to the daemon and does not exist.

Nine ready items left. Item 2 (the verb registry) is next, and it speaks this
crate's vocabulary — read `reach.rs` before starting it, because `Ask` is what a
verb's arguments have to reduce to when the registry asks whether a call is
within its grant.


---

## 2026-09-02 — iteration 2: the verb registry

**Built: item 2.** Five files in `crates/alo-capability`, beside the grants
rather than in a crate of their own, because a verb that cannot be compared
against a grant is not a capability model.

| | |
|---|---|
| `arg.rs` | What an argument can be, what may arrive (`Given`), and what survives arriving (`Value`) |
| `sentence.rs` | The sentence a person approves: words from the verb, holes filled from validated values |
| `verb.rs` | One verb, and everything that has to be true of one — checked where it is declared |
| `verbs.rs` | The closed list, and the only way into it |
| `call.rs` | A validated call: what it would touch, what it would say, and whether the grants permit it |

**The gate:** `cargo fmt --check` clean, `cargo clippy --workspace
--all-targets -- -D warnings` zero warnings and zero errors, 109 tests passing
(37 new, 28 in item 1, 44 in `alo-models`). Built and unit tested on Windows;
**no hardware verification, and none claimed** — nothing here touches a machine,
and the file verbs that will are item 6.

The guarantee `CLAUDE.md` names — *a verb cannot reach outside its grant* — is
now a test rather than a sentence, in `call.rs`: a well-formed call with a
generated sentence over an ungranted folder is refused, and half a move is
refused too.

**What the next iteration must know:**

- **Law 2 is carried by two things, and only one of them is a guarantee.** The
  guarantee is that `Takes` is closed and has no free-text kind, so nothing a
  model composes can arrive as an argument at all. The other is a word list that
  refuses `run_command`, `filter_expression`, `sql_query` at declaration time —
  a tripwire, documented as one in `verb.rs`. **Neither stops a verb's
  implementation from passing an argument to a shell**, and item 6 is where that
  becomes a real temptation. It is on review, and the module docs say so.
- **Being permitted and being approved are separate questions**, and `call.rs`
  answers only the first on purpose. Item 3 must not add "and approved" to
  `Call::permitted_by`: merging them is how "one approval, one execution"
  quietly becomes "one approval, whatever the grant allows". A `Call` is
  `Serialize` and not `Deserialize`, so an approval cannot be built from a call
  read back off a disk.
- **Every argument is required, and the sentence names every argument.** Both
  are refusals at declaration, both are now in the contract, and both exist for
  the same reason: the person approves the sentence, so anything it does not
  describe is something they did not agree to. An item that wants an optional
  argument wants two verbs.
- **The registry starts empty and no verb is declared anywhere yet.** That is
  item 6 (file verbs) and the adapters. Nothing shipped a default capability.
- **`Value` serialises and does not deserialise**, like `Call`. Item 4 (the
  record) can therefore write what ran without inventing a second type — and
  must not add `Deserialize` to either to read its own records back, because a
  value nothing validated would then exist. Read records into a type of the
  record's own.
- **`GrantError`, `Grants::refusal`, `ArgError`, `VerbError`, `CallError` and
  every `Sentence` are English in the source.** Item 9's list is now
  considerably longer, and `sentence.rs` was built as parts rather than a format
  string precisely so that translating it moves only `Part::Words`.

Eight ready items left. Item 3 (approvals) is next, and it speaks this
iteration's vocabulary: read `call.rs` before starting it, because an approval
is over exactly one `Call` and exactly its arguments.


---

## 2026-09-02 — iteration 3: approvals

**Built: item 3.** Four files in `crates/alo-capability`, turning ADR 0001 §5
into a journey a change has to make rather than a rule a daemon has to
remember. Each type can only be reached from the one before it.

| | |
|---|---|
| `proposal.rs` | The question put to a person: the sentence, who it would run as, and when it lapses. A read is refused here, and so is a change the grants already do not permit |
| `approvals.rs` | The list waiting to be answered — propose, approve, decline, sweep — and numbers that are never reused |
| `approval.rs` | One answer, worth exactly one execution, spent by redeeming it |
| `authorised.rs` | The only type in the crate that means may-run, and the two doors into it: a read, or a redeemed approval |

One test-support file came with them: `test_calls.rs`, under `cfg(test)`, so
that four files asking about the same journey do not drift into four journeys.

**The gate:** `cargo fmt --check` clean, `cargo clippy --workspace
--all-targets -- -D warnings` zero warnings and zero errors, 135 tests passing
(24 new plus 2 doctests, 65 in items 1 and 2, 44 in `alo-models`). `cargo doc`
clean. Built and unit tested on Windows; **no hardware verification, and none
claimed** — nothing here touches a machine.

The guarantee `CLAUDE.md` names — *one approval causes exactly one execution* —
is now carried twice. The list refuses a proposal answered a second time, and
`Approved::redeem` takes `self`, so a second execution is not a program that
compiles: that half is a `compile_fail` doctest, with a twin that passes, so
the pair cannot quietly become a test that a typo fails to compile.

**What the next iteration must know:**

- **Item 4 (the record) is now mostly a matter of writing down what these types
  already carry.** `Authorised` answers *what ran, under whose authority, from
  which approval* (`call`, `under`, `from_approval`, `at`), and `Refused`
  carries the call it refused so a refusal is recordable rather than only
  countable. The one thing missing is *against which grant*: `Grants::permits`
  answers yes or no and does not say which grant said yes, and item 4 will need
  a `GrantId` back from it. That is a small addition to `grants.rs` and it
  should be made there rather than by re-deriving the answer in the record.
- **The grants are asked three times on the way to an execution** — when the
  call is checked, when the change is proposed, and last inside `Authorised`.
  The last one is the one that matters, and it is why a revoked grant stops
  something already approved. Nothing caches an answer, and nothing should
  start.
- **`Refused` boxes its `Call`.** Clippy's `result_large_err` was right: every
  authorisation returns it in the `Err`, and the happy path should not carry a
  hundred bytes it never reads. Anything later returning a call-shaped error
  should do the same.
- **Two doctests exist now, where the crate had none.** They are the public
  worked example of the journey, and `cargo test` runs them. If the shape of
  the API moves, they move with it.
- **Nothing is deserialised on the approval path.** `Proposal` and `Approvals`
  serialise so a pending question can be shown or written down, and neither
  reads back — an unanswered question does not survive a restart, which is the
  intended behaviour and not a limitation. Item 4 must read its records into a
  type of the record's own, as iteration 2 already said of `Call` and `Value`.
- **The new user-facing English is on item 9's list**: `ProposalError`,
  `AnswerError`, `NotAuthorised` and the `Refused` display. Every refusal in
  this iteration is a sentence somebody reads.

Seven ready items left. Item 4 (the record) is next.


---

## 2026-09-02 — iteration 4: the record

**Built: item 4.** `crates/alo-record`, ADR 0001 §7 as working code: every
execution and every refusal, kept so that "explain what it did" is a question
put to the record rather than a search through text.

| | |
|---|---|
| `line.rs` | Text as the record keeps it: one line, printable, bounded. Everything that enters the record as words comes through here |
| `written.rs` | One validated argument, written down — a mirror of `Value`, with an exhaustive `From` so a new kind of argument cannot be quietly lost |
| `what.rs` | What a call was: the verb, its arguments, and the sentence a person read |
| `happened.rs` | The four things that can happen — it ran, it was stopped, it never became a call, or a question was answered somewhere |
| `entry.rs` | One moment and what happened at it, with one constructor per point in ADR 0001's journey |
| `record.rs` | The list. Append, read back, and no way to take anything out |
| `explain.rs` | What can be asked: by agent, by span, by grant, by approval, refusals only, egress only |

One test-support file came with them: `test_calls.rs`, under `cfg(test)`.

**The gate:** `cargo fmt --check` clean, `cargo clippy --workspace
--all-targets -- -D warnings` zero warnings and zero errors, 179 tests passing
plus 2 doctests (42 new in `alo-record`, 3 new in `alo-capability`, 1 new in
`alo-models`). `cargo doc --workspace --no-deps` clean. Built and unit tested on
Windows; **no hardware verification, and none claimed** — nothing here touches a
machine, and nothing writes to a disk yet either.

The guarantee `CLAUDE.md` names — *every execution and every refusal leaves a
record* — is a test in `record.rs`, and the three kinds of refusal are each a
test of their own in `entry.rs`.

**The one decision that went against a plan already written down.** Iterations 1
to 3 said the record would live in `alo-capability`, and its module
documentation said so. It does not, and the reason is worth the deviation:

- **the deciding crate must not deserialise.** `Call`, `Value`, `Proposal` and
  `Approvals` serialise and deliberately do not read back, because one read off
  a disk would be a call nothing had validated. A record exists to be read back.
  Housing both in one crate would mean the rule "nothing here deserialises" had
  an exception in the same crate as the thing it protects;
- **the record needs `InferenceSource`**, which lives in `alo-models` — and
  `alo-models` carries `ureq` and a TLS stack for the Ollama adapter. Depending
  on it from `alo-capability` would have put a TLS stack behind the crate whose
  entire value is being small enough for somebody else to audit. `alo-capability`
  still depends on nothing but `serde` and `thiserror`;
- **a crate that decides should not be reachable from one that observes**, so a
  future `Grants` cannot quietly start writing entries about itself.

**What the next iteration must know:**

- **`Grants::permitting` is the one search now**, answering with the `GrantId`
  that permitted something or the refusal in words. `permits` and `refusal` are
  thin wrappers over it, so there is no second search that could disagree with
  the one that decided. `Call::permitting` joins it across every ask and stops
  at the first refusal; `Authorised::against` carries the result. Item 6 gets
  this for free and should not re-derive it.
- **The record's four answers exist at exactly one moment**, inside
  `Authorised`, and `Entry::ran` copies them rather than working them out. A
  daemon that recorded from anywhere else would be recording a second opinion.
- **`Record` has no `forget`**, and that is the item 4a now in the queue: how
  long evidence is kept is one decision made in the open, and it belongs to
  whatever writes the record to a disk. Nothing writes it to a disk yet.
- **Two things are never recorded**, and both are tests rather than sentences:
  the question a person asked (`Happened::Answered` has no field for it), and
  the arguments of a call that never validated. Item 6 will be tempted by the
  second one when file verbs start being refused in quantity.
- **Everything the record shows goes through `Line`** — control characters out,
  collapsed, bounded. The refusal path is why: text from a call that never
  validated was written by whatever the model was persuaded to send, and a
  record read in a terminal must not be able to show one thing and say another.
- **`InferenceSource` now serialises**, which it did not before. It is an
  additive change to `alo-models`' public surface, with a round-trip test beside
  it. Item 5 (egress policy) will want the same of anything it adds.
- **The new user-facing English is on item 9's list.** Less than expected: the
  record deliberately composes no prose, because the explanation a person reads
  is the sentence they already approved. What is there is `Stopped`'s stored
  words, which come from `alo-capability`'s errors and are already on that list.

Seven ready items left, one of them new. Item 5 (egress policy) is next, and it
starts from `source.rs` in `alo-models` and from `Happened::Answered` here —
`Asking::only(Only::Egress)` already answers *what left this machine*, so item 5
is the decision and the indicator rather than the record of it.
