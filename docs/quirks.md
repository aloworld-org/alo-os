# Quirks

Where reality and the specification disagree.

An operating system meets three kinds of reality that no document describes
correctly: hardware and firmware, applications being driven through their own
automation, and pinned upstream engines behaving unlike their manuals. When you
lose an afternoon to one of them, write it down here. The next person should
inherit the knowledge, not the debugging session.

## How to write an entry

One entry per quirk, newest first within each section. Every entry says: **what
it is, what version, what actually happens, what we do about it, and the date.**
A quirk with no version and no date is a rumour.

Keep the accommodation and the reason together. Six months from now the code
will look wrong to somebody, and this file is the only thing standing between
them and reintroducing the bug.

The rule this file serves: **strict in what we do, tolerant in what we accept.**
We behave correctly; we cope with hardware and applications that do not.

## Hardware and firmware

_(no entries yet)_

<!--
### <Machine or component> — <one-line summary>
**Version:** firmware / kernel / driver version the behaviour was seen on
**Behaviour:** what actually happens, as opposed to what is documented
**Our response:** what we do, and why this rather than something else
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD, and who saw it
-->

## Application automation

Applications driven through adapters (`docs/contracts/app-adapters.md`) change
their automation surfaces between versions, sometimes silently. This is where
that gets recorded: which version, what changed, and what the adapter now does.

_(no entries yet)_

<!--
### <Application> <version> — <one-line summary>
**Mechanism:** api | accessibility | dbus | synthetic
**Behaviour:** what the API or the accessibility tree actually does
**Our response:** what the adapter does about it
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
-->

## Pinned engines

The kernel, Mesa, systemd, the model runtime and the fine-tuning stack are
configured, never patched. When one of them behaves unlike its documentation,
the accommodation lives in our configuration and the reason lives here.

An entry here that says "we patched it" is a bug in the process: a source patch
to an engine requires an ADR first.

<!--
### <Engine> <version> — <one-line summary>
**Behaviour:** what it does, versus what is documented
**Our response:** the configuration we apply, and why
**Upstream:** issue link if reported
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Filesystems and paths

A grant is over a place, and a path is only a name for one. Where the two come
apart, a capability check can be correct and still be wrong — so this is where
that gets written down rather than discovered.

### Resolving a path does not defeat a hard link
**Version:** every filesystem alo OS will run on; seen 2026-09-02 in
`alo-files`
**Behaviour:** `alo-files` resolves every path a verb names and asks the grants
about where it really leads, which stops a symbolic link out of a granted
folder. A **hard** link is not a link in that sense: it is a second real name
for the same file, so a hard link inside a granted folder to a file that also
lives outside it resolves to the granted name and passes the check.
**Our response:** nothing in the path layer, because there is nothing honest to
do there — the granted name genuinely is a real name for that file. Making a
hard link needs write access to the granted folder and read access to the
target, so it is not a way *in*; it is a way for somebody who can already write
to a granted folder to widen what an agent may read. It is documented here, in
the contract and in `alo-files`, and the answer if it ever matters is a policy
about link counts at the moment of opening, not a cleverer path comparison.
**Date:** 2026-09-02

### A path checked and then opened by name can change in between
**Version:** every filesystem alo OS will run on; seen 2026-09-02 in
`alo-files`
**Behaviour:** the real path is resolved, the grants permit it, and then the
file is opened by that name. Anything with write access to a folder on the way
can swap a link in between the two.
**Our response:** the check is where it can be, and the fix is not another
check. Whatever opens the file holds on to *what it opened* — `openat` from a
directory handle on Linux — rather than resolving the same name twice. That is
the acting half's, item 6a in `docs/autonomy/QUEUE.md`, and it is written into
the item so it is not discovered afterwards.
**Date:** 2026-09-02

### Windows returns a path spelled differently from the one it was given
**Version:** Windows 11 26200, Rust 1.97 `std::fs::canonicalize`
**Behaviour:** canonicalising `C:\Users\x\Temp\Invoices` gives
`\\?\C:\Users\x\Temp\Invoices`. The two are the same folder and compare as
different paths, component by component, because the verbatim prefix is a
component.
**Our response:** none in the comparison, which is right to be exact — a grant
that matched loosely would match more than the person picked. **A grant is made
over a resolved path**: the folder a person picks is resolved when they pick it,
so both sides of every later comparison are spelled the way the machine spells
them. Written into the contract and asserted in `alo-files`' integration test,
which grants a resolved folder for exactly this reason.
**Date:** 2026-09-02

## Models

Open-weight models in the catalogue have their own personalities: refusing
formats they claim to emit, ignoring stated context limits, or answering in the
wrong language. Where a model in the catalogue misbehaves in a way that affects
the agents, record it here with the exact model and quantisation — "it was fine
for me" is usually a different quantisation.
